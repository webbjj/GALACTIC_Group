This is Ritik's Folder. It contains various plots and the code used to create a
four-body version of corespray that simulates 3+1 stellar interactions within 
the cores of globular clusters. It also contains Ritik's work for the AST425 
course.

The four-body version of corespray was made while referencing several papers, 
each of which are included in the "References" folder.

The "corespray" folder contains the necessary files and code to be able to run 
the original corespray on the user's system. It contains its own "README" file 
for instructions.

The "Initial Corespray 3-Body Tests" folder contains a corespray tutorial for M3
and also a separate tutorial file with modified parameters. This was work done 
at the beginning of AST425 to learn how the tutorial worked. It also contains a
"Plots" folder with a variety of plots created using the M3 tutorial with 
different parameters.

The "Corespray Analysis" folder contains a copy of the original corespraydf 
method that was analyzed and written over with comments. It was used as the 
framework for the new 4-Body version of corespray.

The "Testing" folder contains files that show some testing done (through
trial and error) to determine what functions were ultimately coded into the 
final modified version of corespray. In particular, "4-body sample escape velocity.py"
and "sample four-body func.py" are the test files created for this.

The "coresprayfourbody" folder contains several program files, some of which are
corespray tutorial files for the GCs M3, M15, and M92, and others which are 
comparisons of 3 and 4 body systems within these GCs. 

The "Final Results" folder contains the final version of the four-body corespray
code, as well as Ritik's final presentation and report for the AST425 course.
